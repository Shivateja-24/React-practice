# Job Listings UI (React Practice)

This is a small React practice project focused on building a card-based UI using fundamental React concepts.
The project is intentionally simple and meant to demonstrate hands-on practice rather than a production-ready application.

---

## What This Project Does

- Displays a list of job postings as individual cards
- Each card shows:
  - Company logo (icon-based)
  - Company name
  - Job role
  - Employment type and experience level
  - Pay rate
  - Location
- Cards are rendered dynamically from an array of data

---

## Concepts Practiced

This project was built to practice and reinforce:

- React functional components
- JSX syntax
- Passing data via props
- Destructuring props inside components
- Rendering lists using the map method
- Using stable key values while rendering lists
- Understanding implicit vs explicit returns in arrow functions
- Basic component composition
- Debugging common React rendering issues

---

## Logos and Assets

- Company logos are added manually using public image URLs
- Icon or symbol-style logos are preferred for a clean UI
- No paid or token-based logo APIs are used

Logos are included only for UI demonstration purposes.

## How to Run the Project

npm install
npm run dev

Open the local development URL shown in the terminal.

---

## Purpose of This Project

This project exists to:

- Practice core React concepts through a simple UI
- Improve confidence with component-based design
- Serve as visible proof of consistent learning and practice

The project is intentionally kept minimal and focused.

---

## Possible Improvements

- Move job data to a separate file or API
- Add filters such as full-time or part-time
- Add hover effects and animations
- Improve responsiveness
- Add dark or light mode

---

## Note

This is a learning-focused project.
Code and structure are expected to evolve as more concepts are practiced.
